## Profile
I‚Äôm a **full-stack developer** with 15+ years of experience turning complex ideas into production-ready digital products. My background in **media and interaction design** shapes how I approach software: part engineer, part creative problem-solver. I thrive at the intersection of backend architecture and intuitive frontend design, always keeping usability, maintainability, and performance front and center.

I‚Äôve built and scaled products across industries ‚Äî from broadcasting and e-commerce to data-driven platforms ‚Äî working with teams and tech stacks that include **Node.js, React, PHP, Python, AWS**, and more. I bring a solution-driven mindset and a knack for connecting strategy with hands-on execution.

I enjoy fast-moving environments where knowledge-sharing, automation, and continuous learning are part of the culture. My focus is simple: deliver **meaningful, scalable solutions** that empower both users and teams.
